Object Oriented Software Design
Project 1

In the '1st Iteration' folder, we have diagrams, report and project files that we prepared in the first step.
Our project files in the first step have .zip extension due to the collision problem of class names.

There are final version diagrams and final version report in the second step of '2nd Iteration'.

The final version of our project has source codes and other files in the main folder.
